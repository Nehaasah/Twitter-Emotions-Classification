# Twitter Emotion Classifier

![Twitter Emotion Classifier](img1.png)

The **Twitter Emotion Classifier** is a machine learning project that can analyze and classify the emotions conveyed in tweets. 
This classifier is powered by the BERT model and can detect emotions like sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise in text data.

## About

The **Twitter Emotion Classifier** project aims to provide a robust tool for understanding the emotional content of tweets. 
This classifier can be used for various purposes, including sentiment analysis, social listening, and customer feedback analysis. With its NLP capabilities, it helps uncover the emotions behind the words.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- Develop an NLP model capable of classifying emotions in tweets.
- Create a user-friendly web interface for real-time emotion analysis.
- Enhance text preprocessing and data cleaning techniques.
- Customizable for different use cases by adapting the training data.
- Achieve a deep understanding of the BERT model for natural language processing.

### TechStack
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Streamlit

## Tasks

- Developed the user interface and interactive elements using Streamlit.
- Implemented text preprocessing techniques for optimal model performance.
- Created custom data loaders and fine-tuned the BERT model for emotion classification.
- Conducted extensive testing and validation to ensure the classifier's accuracy.
- Documented the code and created a user-friendly README.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of the Twitter Emotion Classifier, I encountered several challenges:

- Overcoming issues related to data preprocessing and tokenization.
- Optimizing the model's hyperparameters for balanced accuracy.
- Managing memory and computational resources for efficient real-time predictions.
- Addressing dependencies and compatibility challenges among libraries.

## Solutions

1. For data preprocessing challenges, I researched and applied advanced techniques such as text normalization, stemming, and stop-word removal. This enhanced the model's ability to handle noisy text data.
2. I carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters by experimenting with learning rates, batch sizes, and model architectures, while monitoring the model's performance on a validation dataset to identify the best configuration.
3. To tackle resource management issues, I implemented data loading pipelines to efficiently handle real-time predictions. Additionally, I optimized the app's code and made use of appropriate hardware resources to ensure a smooth user experience.
4. To resolve dependency and compatibility issues, I maintained a clear record of library versions and systematically verified that all components had compatible versions. This ensured that the project could be easily reproduced and run by others.

## Skills Acquired

Throughout this project, I acquired the following skills and knowledge:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using state-of-the-art models like BERT.
- Text preprocessing and data cleaning techniques.
- Building interactive web applications with Streamlit.
- Data loading and fine-tuning deep learning models.
- Problem-solving and debugging in complex ML projects.
